## Project Goals

There are two main goals of this project: 
- Create a tool that allows web-creators to generate their own website which shows their index of interest, maps it on the US map at varying geospatial scales. End audience will be anyone who faces the website rendered by web-creators. Since different audiences deem certain indicators of the index more important than the other, this website allows audiences to choose their own combination of indicators that they consider significant when constructing the final index. 
- Use this tool to create a website for stakeholders in the water sector to assess and prioritize areas based on their potential benefit from investing in water reuse infrastructure. 

Deliverables include: 
- Index measuring potential benefits that communities can get from water reuse.
- Visualization of that index through mapping
- User interface and generalizable R code that allows users to choose their own components of the index and to map it

## Ethical Considerations

Q) **Anyone** can create **any** type of index. What do we make of it?ü§î
- We've had a discussion on potential perils of tool that is too general. With this tool, it allows any stakeholders in any fields to create their own index, making it vulnerable to potential manipulation. We explicitly addressed difficult use cases like selection of a biased set of indicators to get the index they want to use. 
With a series of discussion and feedback from stakeholder engagement interviews, we learned that communities and various interest groups have already been using various tools to portray themselves in ways that favor them. Our tool can indeed empower under-resourced communities to make a more compelling cases to decision makers by utilizing data-driven index and its intuitive visualization. We further decided *not* to offer the option of adjusting weights assigned to indicators as a default feature. This can mitigate the concern of tuning the index value by arbitrarily changing the weight assigned to constituting indicators. 

Q) How do we empower technically less experienced users to the greatest extent? 
- We have spoken with lots of substance-matter experts in the water reuse field who do not use data-analyses much in daily tasks. We thought it is important to make sure that our products can reach the public beyond the data scientists. To address the concern, our website allows end-users to interact with the index by selecting what goes in to calculate the index, and allowing them to download the re-calculated index. 

Q) Why PCA over othe dimensionality-reduction methodologies? 
- After a robust literature review, we have explored different options of calculating index. While there were many compelling methods like archetypal analysis, [ToxiPi](https://github.com/uwescience/WaterReuseDSSG2024/blob/99457ddc865665cc959418b318d7c2a2ddc3819f/code/create_index/toxpi-wrapper.R#L7), we decided to provide weighted-average PCA as a default. This is because PCA provided the most transparent pipeline and allowed subject-matter expert (web-creator) to assign weights.

Q) Should we consider all wastewater to have water reuse potential?
- We need to consider water rights, as some water has to return to waterbodies. There are downstream communities that rely on treated water as their drinking water. 

## Stakeholders

| **User Group** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Creator**    | Using R code, we publish: <br> ‚Ä¢ Decide which variables go into the index (must be clean & processed) <br> ‚Ä¢ Specify weight received by each variable <br> ‚Ä¢ Specify how index is calculated <br> ‚Ä¢ Run a script that creates HTML, JS, & R code they can publish as a website (audience is web users) |
| **Web Users**  | Engage with the website, where an interactive map and index creation tool are located. |
