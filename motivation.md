**Questions**

There are two main goals for this project: 
- Creating a general tool that allows users to create their own index of interest and map it on the US continental map. 
- Use this tool to create a set of deliverables for stakeholders in the water sector to assess and prioritize areas based on their potential benefit from investing in water reuse infrastructure. 

Deliverables include: 
- Index measuring potential benefits that communities can get from water reuse.
- Visualization of that index through mapping
- User interface and generalizable R code that allows users to choose their own components of the index and to map it.
