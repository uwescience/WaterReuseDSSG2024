## geo-ndxr

`geo-ndxr` is a low-code tool that enables R users to create custom-made, dynamic websites showcasing a geographic index.

`geo-ndxr` helps R users, called Creators, pre-process the data they want to include in an index, calculate the index, and map it. From there, Creators can make their index website available to web users as an `.html` file hosted on a service like Github pages. The index website includes a basic graphical user interface that enables web users to tweak the default index generated by the creator. 

`geo-ndxr` uses [WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) to deliver computation **directly in the web user's browser**, making it drastically easier for creators to spin up and host a website containing their index.
