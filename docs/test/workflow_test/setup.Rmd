## Set up
In order to source our functions, folder structure in the user's computer should be identical with the structure we have in Github. 
One way of doing this is to clone the entire repository. If you're an R Studio user, click on the "Terminal" tab right next to "Console" and type in `<gh repo clone uwescience/WaterReuseDSSG2024>`.
Once done, execute the next lines of code to check your currenr directory and source codes.

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(altair, stars, usmap, raster, exactextractr, tidycensus,tidyverse,sf,data.table,tigris,car,janitor,rmapshaper, terra, qgisprocess, docstring, dplyr)

print(getwd())
source("code/crosswalk/general-crosswalk.R")

source("code/mapping/mapper.R")

```

## Help functions
```{r}
docstring(crosswalk)
```


## Load datasets of interest
```{r}

```
