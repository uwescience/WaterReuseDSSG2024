*Drivers of Water Reuse*

Different communities can have different motivations for reusing water. We categorized them into 7 "drivers." We aim at creating an index that delivers information about potential benefits of water reuse and visualizing it. 

|  | **Drivers**                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| 🪣  | Discharge Volume Limitations           |
| 🦦  | Runoff Quality and Nutrient Management |
| 🐠  | Sensitive Ecosystems (Discharge Quality Limitations )|
| 🔩  | Infrastructure Vulnerability           |
| 🚰 | Water Scarcity                         |
| ♻ | Leveraging Existing Infrastructure     |
| 🟰| Socioeconomic Factors                  |

*General Solution: _GeoNdxR_*

The entire process of 1) cleaning geospatial data at different scale, 2) reducing redundancy across different indicators, 3) visualizing it in an intuitive way, and 4) presenting the final index in a convincing manner, can benefit a lot from having a streamlined general pipeline. Instead of building a specific tool that only fits data sets at hand, we came up with a general solution *GeoNdxR*.
