  #' of the original variables in order to recalculate the index
  #' 
  #' @param cols_to_keep a vector of 1/0 representing the columns that should 
  #' STAY in the filtered dataset AFTER the ignored columns are removed. 
  #' For example, if a dataset has columns 'geometry', 'var1', 'var2', 'var3'
  #' and the user wants to ignore 'geometry' (because it is non-numerical)
  #' and recalculate the index on 'var1' and 'var3' ONLY, the function would
  #' be called with `cols_to_keep = c(1,0,1)`
  #' 
  #' @param cols_to_ignore columns to disregard entirely. This is NOT the same
  #' as columns that should be DROPPED. Columns to disregard are non-numeric
  #' columns like `geometry` or an ID. Columns to DROP are numeric columns 
  #' that the user does not want to include in the filtered dataset / 
  #' recalculated index
  #' 
  #' The geometry column in a simple feature (sf) object is automatically
  #' disregarded and does not need to be specified in the argument
