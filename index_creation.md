## Index Calculation Process
Conversion to Percentiles:

- Standardization: The first step in creating the index is to standardize the data by converting all non-percentile data into percentiles. Percentiles rank each data point relative to the rest of the dataset, placing values on a uniform scale from 0 to 100. This ensures that the data is comparable across different metrics and categories, regardless of their original units or scales.
- Why Percentiles? Percentiles are particularly useful because they allow us to compare different types of data on the same scale.
